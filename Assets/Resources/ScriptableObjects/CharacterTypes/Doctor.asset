  Quotes:
  - "I\u2019m glad everyone\u2019s so healthy. It gives me a lot of free time."
  - Discretion is important in my position. I would never talk about my patients'
    body issues. Never.
  - There's no flu season on the asteroid, but maybe we should give vaccinations any
    way. Just in case.
